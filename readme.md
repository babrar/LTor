# LTor-dev
Development currently on hold due to high academic workload. Planning to resume
development from Dec 2020.

## Roadmap
My base implementation is heavily inspired by allen-torrent's one. However, unlike allen's version, I plan to use **WebRTC** to create direct peer-to peer connections.

Further down the road, there's also a UI coming!
